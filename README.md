# Dogs and Cats classification using Deep learning Pretrained-model

## Summary
* Dogs and Cats classification is supposed to be a basic and essential computer vision task for everyone learning deep learning.
* The task is to create a deep learning model using a pretrained model combined with CNN (Convolutional Neural Networ) and DNN (Dense Neural Network) layers in order to distinguish cat and dog images.
* As an output of this task, the advantages of pretrained model in computer vision tasks are demonstrated.
* The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle

## Implementation and Result
* The course of implementation is presented step by step in the notebook comprising:
    *  Data preprocessing
    *  Data augementation
    *  Data pipeline
    *  Building model and training
*  A list of pretrained model is tested to figure out which is the best suit for this case. The model is chosen is Xception with the accuracy up to 99%
